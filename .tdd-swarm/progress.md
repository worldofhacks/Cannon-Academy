# Progress Ledger — Cannon Academy engine core

Append-only. Every state change gets a line. On session start or after compaction,
READ THIS FILE AND `git log` BEFORE DISPATCHING ANYTHING — work marked complete is
complete; resume at the first incomplete ticket. Never re-dispatch finished work.

## Phase 0 — Preconditions (2026-07-27)

- Scope locked: `src/engine/**` + `src/content/**` (pure TS). RN/Firebase/EAS out — see posture.md.
- Posture: **mvp** (owner-selected). Test runner: **vitest** (owner-selected).
- `git init` on a previously untracked directory; planning docs preserved untouched.
- Harness scaffolded: vitest 3 + TS strict (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) + eslint 9 flat + prettier + zod.
- Architecture invariants encoded as lint rules and **proven firing**: engine purity (no React/RN/Expo/Firebase in `src/engine/`), determinism (`Math.random`/`Date` banned).
- Gate scripts written and executed: `run-local-gates.sh` (7 gates PASS), `run-repo-gates.sh` (5 PASS, 1 deferred), `spec-lint.sh` (proven RED on an untested AC).
- Baseline audit was RED (8 high, transitive `brace-expansion`); fixed via `overrides` pin → **0 vulnerabilities**.
- Baseline recorded: 1 test passing, 0 type errors, 0 lint errors, 0 audit findings.
- Lessons seeded: L-001, L-002, L-003.

**Status: Phase 0 COMPLETE — all gates green.** Next: Phase 1 planning.

## Phase 1 — Planning (2026-07-27)

- Decomposed `src/engine/**` + `src/content/**` into **24 tickets across 8 waves**
  (`tickets/T-001.md` … `T-024.md`, index in `TICKETS.md`).
- Wave assignment and `file_scopes` exclusivity verified mechanically: every ticket sits at the
  earliest wave its dependencies allow, and no two tickets in a wave share a file. The only
  cross-wave file overlaps are T-022 extending `duel/types.ts` (T-013) and `duel/reducer.ts`
  (T-020), each as sole owner of those files in wave 7.
- All 24 tickets parse under `spec-lint.sh` with contiguous `AC-n` ids; all currently RED, which
  is correct before the Test Agent runs.
- Every ticket has a non-empty `traces_to`. Coverage map and the explicit list of uncovered
  in-scope work: `.tdd-swarm/traceability.md`.
- **16 open questions raised for the human** (traceability.md §2) — unspecified numbers were
  either named as behaviour-pinned `tuning.ts` constants or escalated; none was invented.
- **12 planning gaps recorded** (traceability.md §3), incl. one recommended follow-up ticket
  (captain-name wordlist filter, ARCHITECTURE.md §11).
- No `Eval` rows anywhere: there is no LLM in this codebase.

**Status: Phase 1 COMPLETE — tickets frozen, awaiting Wave 1 dispatch.**
